# WarpPCHIP-Net
WarpPCHIP-Net integrates RNN memory, convolutional extraction, and PCHIP warping for O(N) long-sequence modeling via serial token processing. Core innovations: non-uniform PCHIP memory (sparse distant for compression, dense recent for detail) and learnable sampling grid. Ideal for language modeling and time-series forecasting.
